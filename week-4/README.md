# Week 4 - Character Strings and Formatted Input and Output

In chapter 4, we overviewed the basics of character strings in C and discussed some ways to utilize `printf()` and `scanf` to format input and output. The main topics were: 

* `char` arrays to imitate strings
* `#define` and `const` keywords
* `printf()` and `scanf()`'s function prototypes and details

## Programs

1) **Character Studio**
   * Allows a user to enter in a long string
   * Offers a menu to count the frequency of a specific character, view the reversed string, and check if a string is a palindrome
