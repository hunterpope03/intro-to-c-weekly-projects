# Week 3 - Data in C

In chapter 3, we overviewed the basic principles of data in C. The main topics were: 

* Variables and constants
* Primitive data types (`int`, `float`, `char`)
* Type modifiers (`short`, `long`, `signed`, `unsigned`)
* Memory usage & interaction

## Programs

1) **Temperature Converter**
* Allows a user to choose a temperature unit and enter in a temperature value
* Converts the value to other units and outputs the results

2) **Data Type Size Visualizer**
* Displays detailed information on the byte size and range of characters, integers, and floating-point values
* Adds type modifiers to show how they change the size and range of a value
* Visualizes each combination of type and modifier to allow for visual comparisons of data types
